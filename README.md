## Abstract

Search-based motion planning with motion primitives is a complete and optimal method, and it can generate dynamically feasible, collision-free, smooth trajectories in dense obstacle environments. 

To improve the computational efficiency of this method, we focus on the motion primitive graph search method and collision detection method, and propose three improvements: 

- design an admissible heuristic function that considers environmental obstacles

- propose two motion primitive cost penalty strategies

- propose a novel motion primitive collision detection method with linear complexity based on Sturm's Theor In structured obstacle environments
